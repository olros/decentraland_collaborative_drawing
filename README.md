# Decentraland collaborative drawing

This repository contains code for a Decentraland Smart Item which displays an image and refreshes it at a given interval, and redirects the user to an optional URL on click.

The website is a collaborative pixel drawing website where everyone can continue on each drawing. They're saved to Firebase Firestore continuously. It does also expose an url where the drawing can be retrived as a generated `.png`-image.

This project was created for Experts in Team at NTNU for the village MFEL4853. Users can in Decentraland view drawings, which can be clicked and edited while being continuously refreshed inside Decentraland. Thus creating a collaborative drawing experience.
